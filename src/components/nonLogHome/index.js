      <h1>Welcome to RunnersMatch!</h1>
      <p className='landingParagraph'>
    	Welcome to RunnserMatch! We believe the key to getting motivation
    	 in training is to have a great training partner. Our website will
    	  match you with like minded runners at a similar fitness level to
    	   you so that you can find the right person to train with. No longer
    	    will you be dropped early in your run by your groupmates. Nor
    	     will you be at the front of the pack with nobody to motivate you.
    	      We want our athletes to push each other to new heights and
    	      become the best athletes they can be.
      </p>

    	This website is the creation of Tyler Rule, Harmen Kang, Austin King and
    	 Brandon Jacobson.  We are all 4th year students at UC Santa Cruz and have
    	 created this site as a project for our CSE 115 Introduction to software
    	 engineering course.  We are all atheletes specializing in different sports
    	 and noticed a gap in sports training that needs to be filled.  This idea
    	 was created by Tyler and Harmen who are both atheletes on the UCSC NCAA Cross
    	 Country and Track and Field Team.  As runners they were able to notice how
    	 difficult it was to train by themselves so they conceived this idea to
    	 help out with their training.  Austin and Brandon are both avid cyclists and
    	 saw this idea and immediately wanted to participate in the project with
    	 the hopes of one day expanding the site to accomodate other sports such as
    	 cycling.
      </p>

      <p className='landingParagraph'>
    	Future goals of the site include expanding the site to include multiple
    	sports as stated before.  These sports include but are not limited to
    	swimming, hiking, cycling and any other sport where a training companion
    	may prove extremelely beneficial.  Additionally we would like to integrate
    	 the Strave API so other users can see how others they match with train
    	to help decide if they would be a good match.  Next we would like to
    	incorporate some sort of premium membership that gives users extra features
    	that are not available with the subscription.  Our final goal is to partner
    	with various athletic brands and feature their advertisments to our users
    	so users can discover new merchandise and tools their favorite companies
    	have to offer.
