# RunnersMatch

To run the site into the 'src' folder and run the following commands to install necessary helper-files: 

npm install 

npm install react-router-dom 

npm install firebase 

npm install recompose

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the site exit the src folder (so you're in runners-match-revised) and then type "npm start" in the command line to get ther server running.  Your default browser should automatically open up and load the site within a couple minutes and if it does not simply type "localhost:3000" into the URL of the browser of your choice to access the site

The plan for this project is to create a web application that is able to gather data from users about their running experience and match them up with potential training partners.

Immidiate goals is to get the web page running with a few basic functions including the basic outline for the site, a user profile page, and a matching system.

Distant goals for the project include broadening the site to also allow bikers/swimmers/any other sport that could require a training partner to find partners and adding a messaging system for users to talk to potential partners.
